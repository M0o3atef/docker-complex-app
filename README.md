This project is done by Mohamed Atef for the purpose of learning the creation of a complex project containing multiple containers and network between them using Docker. This was done as per the `Udemy` course called [Docker and Kubernetes: The Complete Guide](https://www.udemy.com/course/docker-and-kubernetes-the-complete-guide/).

It contains all dockerfiles needed, docker-compose file to create all of them and the nginx server configuration.
